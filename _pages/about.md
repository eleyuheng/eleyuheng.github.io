This is Dr. Heng Yu's research site. He is currently an Associate Professor in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/science-engineering/departments-schools/cs/home.aspx), University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC). His current researh interest lies in embedded AI and AI-empowered digital system design, with focus on system-level algorithms leveraging application's or circuit's adaptability for optimization. Find more about him in the [Bio page](https://eleyuheng.github.io/bio/).

> Ph.D. vacancies available in the above research themes. Motivated students with a relevant MSc. or MEng. degree (or excellent Bachelor degree) are welcome to contact him for discussion.
